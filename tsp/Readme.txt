6. Then, it will ask you to give the following inputs:
				
				1) enter simp for simple and soph for sophisticated
				
				2)enter the number of cities

				4)enter the meb value
				
				5)enter the start city( if simp selected in algorithm )
7. Then, output will be displayed on the commandline itself.


9. The 2runs.txt file contains the output of 2 test cases, which are:
				1) algorithm=simple
				   number of cities=30
				   cost function=c2
				
				2) algorithm=sophisticated
				   number of cities=30
				   cost function=c2
